/*
**Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
**
**A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
**
**Example:
**
**X X X X
**X O O X
**X X O X
**X O X X
**After running your function, the board should be:
**
**X X X X
**X X X X
**X X X X
**X O X X
**Explanation:
**
**Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any
**'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
**Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
**on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected
**if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
